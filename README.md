USA Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Overview:
This project focuses on predicting housing prices in the USA using a linear regression model. By analyzing various factors such as location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, area size, and year built, we aim to develop an accurate model for predicting housing prices.

Key Features:
Dataset: Utilized a comprehensive dataset containing information about housing prices and relevant features across different regions in the USA.
Data Preprocessing: Conducted extensive data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Engineered new features such as price per square foot and age of the property to improve model performance.
Model Development: Developed a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on the selected features.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score.
Insights and Recommendations: Provided insights into the factors that significantly influence housing prices in different regions and offered recommendations for homebuyers and real estate investors.
Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
